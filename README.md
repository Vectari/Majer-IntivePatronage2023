#Mateusz Majer - Intive Patronage 2023

This is repository of application thatâ€™s allow to create and log in to account to show transaction history fetch from API.
It consists with four pages:
    1. Welcome page - allow to log in, create account or change application language 
    2. Login page - allow  to log in to existing account or change language 
    3. Registration page - allow to register account or change language 
    4. User panel page - showing two charts and transaction history in table, or change language 

Application use HTML, CSS and JS. I added free icons for better visual experience.
User information and language are store in session store.
You can create an account by meeting the registration requirements, if something is not right you will see error massage below input which error concerns. 
On mobile devices you can show detail of each transaction by clicking on it (one at the time can be expand)
